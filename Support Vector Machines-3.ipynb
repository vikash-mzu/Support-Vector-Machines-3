    "Q1. In Order to Predict House Price Based on Several Characteristics, Such as Location, Square Footage, Number of Bedrooms, etc., You Are Developing an SVM Regression Model. Which Regression Metric in This Situation Would Be the Best to Employ?\n",
    "When predicting house prices, the best regression metric depends on the goals of your prediction. Here are a few metrics you might consider:\n",
    "•\tMean Absolute Error (MAE): Provides a straightforward measure of prediction accuracy in the same units as the target variable (house prices). MAE is robust to outliers and gives a clear interpretation of average error magnitude.\n",
    "•\tMean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones due to squaring the error terms. It is sensitive to outliers and provides an indication of how well the model is fitting the data.\n",
    "•\tRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, also in the same units as the target variable, provides a measure of prediction accuracy that is more interpretable than MSE alone.\n",
    "•\tR-Squared (R2R^2R2): Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. It is useful for understanding the proportion of variance explained but doesn't measure the magnitude of error directly.\n",
    "Given that you're working with house prices and likely need both interpretability and a sense of how well the model performs, RMSE might be a good choice because it provides a measure of the average prediction error in the same units as house prices, which is directly interpretable.\n",
    "Q2. You Have Built an SVM Regression Model and Are Trying to Decide Between Using MSE or R-Squared as Your Evaluation Metric. Which Metric Would Be More Appropriate If Your Goal Is to Predict the Actual Price of a House as Accurately as Possible?\n",
    "MSE (Mean Squared Error) would be more appropriate for predicting the actual price of a house as accurately as possible. This is because MSE directly measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, giving a clear sense of how far off your predictions are from the true values. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "R-Squared is more about how well your model explains the variance in the target variable but does not provide direct information about prediction accuracy. Therefore, for evaluating prediction accuracy specifically, MSE is generally preferred.\n",
    "Q3. You Have a Dataset with a Significant Number of Outliers and Are Trying to Select an Appropriate Regression Metric to Use with Your SVM Model. Which Metric Would Be the Most Appropriate in This Scenario?\n",
    "In the presence of significant outliers, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is often more appropriate than MSE or RMSE. This is because MAE is less sensitive to outliers and provides a measure of average error that is less affected by extreme values compared to squared error metrics.\n",
    "MSE and RMSE can be disproportionately influenced by outliers due to the squaring of errors, which makes them less robust in situations with significant outliers.\n",
    "Q4. You Have Built an SVM Regression Model Using a Polynomial Kernel and Are Trying to Select the Best Metric to Evaluate Its Performance. You Have Calculated Both MSE and RMSE and Found That Both Values Are Very Close. Which Metric Should You Choose to Use in This Case?\n",
    "If MSE and RMSE values are very close, RMSE is typically preferred due to its interpretability. RMSE is in the same units as the target variable (e.g., house prices), making it easier to understand the magnitude of prediction errors in the context of the actual data.\n",
    "MSE is useful for comparing different models and understanding how well the model fits, but RMSE provides a more intuitive measure of prediction accuracy that reflects average error in the units of the target variable.\n",
    "Q5. You Are Comparing the Performance of Different SVM Regression Models Using Different Kernels (Linear, Polynomial, and RBF) and Are Trying to Select the Best Evaluation Metric. Which Metric Would Be Most Appropriate if Your Goal Is to Measure How Well the Model Explains the Variance in the Target Variable?\n",
    "If your goal is to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable, R-Squared (R2R^2R2) is the most appropriate metric. R2R^2R2 indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. A higher R2R^2R2 value means that the model explains more of the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "While R2R^2R2 does not provide information about the magnitude of errors directly, it is useful for understanding how well different models capture the relationship between the features and the target variable.\n",
